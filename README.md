# Glass-Effect-Website
- This site was an image on a social networking site
- The original image is in the imges folder and the name of the image is (Required design)
==========================================================================================================
## I converted this image into code
- I did not apply the original appearance of the site, but I changed some things
- Modifications :-
1- I changed the background
2- I changed the font type used
3- And some simple changes as well
!- I know these aren't big changes, but I'm still a beginner, my friendðŸ˜…
=========================================================================================================
- Some problems on the site :-
1. I think there is only one problem, which is that the site is not responsive to all screens, and I changed it as much as I could to make it responsive.
==========================================================================================================
!!- You may have some problems in the code, and you may have a better way to write it. Me too. With time, I will certainly have better ways to code a site like this. Thank you for your time. Good luck to all of us.
